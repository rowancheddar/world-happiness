# Introduction
This project explores global happiness trends using data on economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, corruption, and generosity. The analysis helps uncover patterns that influence the overall happiness score of countries.
- The dataset contains happiness scores and contributing factors for countries around the world.
- Various statistical methods and data visualization techniques are applied to uncover insights.
- A machine learning model is trained using scikit-learn (sklearn) to predict happiness scores based on input features.
